        <h2>Chocolate Chip Cookies Ingredients</h2>
        <article>
            <strong>Butter:</strong> This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor. <br>
            <strong>Eggs:</strong> Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together. <br>
            <strong>Vanilla:</strong> Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies. <br>
            <strong>Baking soda:</strong> Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise. <br>
            <strong>Water:</strong> A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up. <br>
            <strong>Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty. <br>
            <strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough. <br>
            <strong>Chocolate chips:</strong> Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer. <br>
            <strong>Nuts (optional):</strong> Walnuts are optional, but they add nutty flavor and a welcome crunch. <br>
