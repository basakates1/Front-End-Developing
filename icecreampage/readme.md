This is the project in order to finish an assignment in https://academy.patika.dev/courses/bootstrap/odev1
It is my first time trying to do a responsive webpage using Bootstrap.
<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
In this project, I used  grid,jumbotron and card system in Bootsteap to learn more about them. 
All the pages were created in fluid container to have full-screen responsive nav menu, and into that,added another seperate container to add required items.
<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
In the main page, the information under greeting was written in a jumbotron and the ice cream types were written in cards in the grid system.
Products were written in a container with grid that have card images above them.
The page "about us" were created in container with the cards. Each element is a different card.

I DO NOT OWN ANY PHOTOS in the website. I found them online.
