This is the project in order to finish an assignment in https://academy.patika.dev/courses/bootstrap/odev1
It is my first time trying to do a responsive webpage using Bootstrap.
<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
In the main page, the information under greeting was written in a jumbotron and the ice cream types were written in cards in the grid system.
Products were written in a container with grid that have card images above them.
The page "about us" were created in container with the cards. Each element is a different card.

I DO NOT OWN ANY PHOTOS in the website. I found them online.
